# vROOm

A mobile-first rideshare app where people can post trips they're taking, request to join trips posted by others, manage riders on their trips, and communicate with other riders to plan the details of their road trips. The goal of vROOm is to create a place where anyone can share their trips so that we can reduce the impact on the environment of car travel and increase the impact of human connection.
