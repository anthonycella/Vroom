# Vroom

A mobile first rideshare app in which users can plan road trips, request to join a trip another user created, manage users in their own trips, and communicate with other users to plan the details of their road trips. The purpose is so that users can share rides on long road trips and split the cost: reducing road congestion, carbon emmissions, and road trip costs.

## Getting Started

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rfe-Ride-Share/Hidden-Sand-Village
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. To prepare client-side code
   ```
   npm run client-dev
   ```
4. To start the server (in a separate terminal window)
   ```
   npm run server-dev
   ```
5. Open up a browser window and navigate to this url
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
6. For realistic mobile view results, open up chrome dev tools and change the viewport to iPhone SE
